Portfolio
=========

My current portfolio with some of the stuff I've done.

====================

The structure:
- Programming:
--- C#
------ NotJustSokoban - the first group project while I was in the Telerik Academy. The project idea was mine (choosen among several others), and my main job was to implement the Map Loading logic. There are two types of map description: as a matrix and as JSON.
------ WebAPI with Code First - a homework in the same Telerik Academy.

--- Databases - Homeworks from the Databases course in Telerik Academy
------ Advanced SQL
------ Transact-SQL
------ XML

--- HTML5 - Homeworks from the Web Track in Telerik Academy (courses: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
------ Semantic HTML
------ CSS
------ JS OOP
------ jQuery

--- Objective-C
------ iTravel - the final group project in the MentorMate Acedemy. My main parts are related to the MapView.

--- PHP
------ Books With Views - this is another homework from an external course in the Telerik Academy. The course was designed mostly towards beginners, so there were no frameworks studied. The code is procedural, since the OOP was not studied yet.
