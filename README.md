1. C#
	* NotJustSokoban *(Telerik Academy, C# OOP Course, March 2013)* - The first group project I've done in Telerik Academy. This is an implementation of the game Sokoban, using C# and OOP. It took us about 4-5 days to implement it. My part of the code was to write the Map Loading. Two types of maps can be loaded - from a matrix (internally coded) and loaded from external JSON. The game has one map that is played co-op (two people or one using two sets of controllers for each character).
